# to run from jupyter notebook

simply go to a cell and write:

%matplotlib inline

import simulation


____________
Right now the simulation is run for 8 seconds without any attractors just the background noise.

This will show 5 plots
1. a spike raster of pyramidal cells of MC0
2. a spike raster of pyramidal cells of HC0
3. a spike raster of pyramidal cells of the whole network
4. a spike raster of basket cells of one HC
5. a voltage trace of one pyramidal neuron
