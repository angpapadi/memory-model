# to run from jupyter notebook

simply go to a cell and write:

%matplotlib inline
import simulation


____________
This will show 5 plots
1. a spike raster of pyramidal cells of HC0
2. a spike raster of pyramidal cells of the whole network
3. a spike raster of basket cells of the whole network
4. a histogram of spikes across the total simulation time ( here 8seconds)
5. a histogram of cv2 values of the neurons in HC0
